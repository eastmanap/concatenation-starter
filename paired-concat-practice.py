# Concatenation Practice


# Work with your assigned partner
# Each person in your team should take turns writing the code to create and display longer strings
# Check your partner's code for spelling, capitalization, and coding errors
# Correct any bugs in your code

# Part 1
# Create variables to store your first, middle, and last name
# Have Python print a message that contains your concatenated full name, i.e., your combined first, middle and last names
first_name = 'Apollos'
middle_name = 'John'
last_name = 'Eastman'
print (first_name +' '+ middle_name +' '+ last_name )

# Part 2
# Assume you're building a Space Invaders game
# Use concatenation to create and display a custom welcome message that includes the player's first name
print ('Welcome ' + first_name + ', to Space Invaders!')


# Part 3
# Use concatenation to build and display a string that includes your first name, last name, and the year you were born
year = 2008
print ('I am ' + first_name + ' ' + last_name + ' and I was born in ' + str(year)+'.')


# Part 4
# Use concatenation to create and display a sentence that says which country in the world
# you would visit if money were no object
country = 'japan'
print ('I would like to visit' + ' the country of ' + country)
